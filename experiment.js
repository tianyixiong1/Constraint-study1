        <div style="text-align:left; max-width:800px; margin:auto;">
          <p>We are asking you to participate in a research study titled <em>“Social Judgment and Decision-Making”</em>. 
          We will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions. This form has information to help you decide 
          whether or not you wish to participate – please review it carefully. Your participation is voluntary. This study is 
          being led by Professor Jordan Wylie, Department of Psychology.</p>
          
          <h3>What the study is about</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this research is to explore how people view and judge the actions of a character in a story differently. 
          You will be made unaware of the full nature or purpose of the research to maintain validity of the research, 
          but you will be fully debriefed at the end.</p>
          
          <h3>What we will ask you to do</h3>
          <p>We will ask you to...</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Complete a study that takes approximately [5–30] minutes. The study will include demographic questions (e.g., age, gender), brief tasks or vignettes, and questions about your thoughts, perceptions, and reactions. In some cases, you may be asked to read short stories or view images before answering questions.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>Risks and discomforts</h3>
          <p>Participants will be asked questions and encounter stimuli involving moral beliefs, 
          which may be uncomfortable. The images presented will include images from a standardized set, including gross and 
          disgusting things like rotten food and vomit as well as scary things like snakes and spiders. While there are 
          measures put in place by the researcher to secure data, there is always a risk of a potential breach of 
          confidentiality. Please tell the researchers if you believe you are harmed from your participation in the study. </p>
          
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <p>It is hoped that this study will contribute to knowledge about how people view and make judgements about 
          others. You are not expected to directly benefit from participation in the study.</p>
          
          <h3>Incentives for participation</h3>
          <p>You will receive course credit for the time spent participating at a rate of 1 credit per hour. If participating 
          through Prolific/Cloud, you will be paid [$0.75-$4.50] (<em>rate of $9/hr</em>) for your participation in the study. </p>
          
          <h3>Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security</h3>
          <p>You will not be asked to provide information that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
          
          <p>We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet.</p>
          
          <p>Please note that the survey(s) are being conducted with the help of <em>JsPsych</em>, an organization not affiliated with 
          Cornell and with its own privacy and security policies that you can find at its website. We anticipate that your 
          participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet. </p>
          
          <h3>Sharing De-identified Data Collected in this Research</h3>
          <p>De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to advance science and 
          health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with 
          other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to 
          identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your 
          personal data.</p>
          
          <h3>Taking part is voluntary</h3>
          <p>Please remember that your participation is voluntary. You may refuse to participate before the study begins, 
          discontinue at any time, or skip any questions/procedures that may make you feel uncomfortable, with no 
          penalty to you, and no effect on the compensation earned before withdrawing. Withdrawing from the study 
          will have no effect on your academic standing, record, or relationship with the university or other organization 
          or service that may be involved with the research. If you choose not to participate in this research study, 
          please ask your instructor, who should provide you with comparable assignments that you may choose to 
          complete (e.g. writing assignments, participation in other research experiments etc.).</p>
          
          <h3>If you have questions</h3>
          <p>The main researcher conducting this study is Jordan Wylie, a professor at Cornell University. Please ask any 
          questions you have now. If you have questions later, you may contact Professor Jordan Wylie at

      <h3>What was this study about?</h3>
      <p>Our research lab is broadly interested in moral psychology—that is, better 
      understanding the ways that moral judgments, moral states, and moral values, 
      alongside other states, influence cognition and memory. Below are some of the specific 
      questions we are currently exploring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do moral states influence judgments, decision-making, and broader cognition?</li>
        <li>Do moral judgments and blame affect judgments, cognition, and memory?</li>
        <li>How does moral information influence the extent to which rules and rule-breakers should be punished?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your participation helps us answer these questions, which in turn has implications for 
      public figures, policy, and law. We are committed to sharing our research findings in 
      ways that are accessible and relevant to the public.</p>
